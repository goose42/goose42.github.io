I recently purchased an iPad [^1], and I am slowing trying to find things to do with it. Sometimes it feels like it is a solution in search of a problem, other times it feels like a the whole world is moving towards sovinging an entirely new set of problems and tools such as the iPad are built for that future. 

Getting to the point of this post. I want to test the ability to work with github pages. Here is the workflow that I have settled upon: I am writing up my notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), an app that seems like a capable markdown editor.  I am pushing up changes to GitHub / creating PRs using an app called [Code app](https://thebaselab.com/code/). Hopefully this should be it?
